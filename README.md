# codecademy-tea-cozy-flexbox-project
This off-platform project was completed as part of the **Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer career program** (Layout with Flexbox module).

**Concepts Practiced:**

  Flexbox container and item behavior

  justify-content and layout distribution

  Managing spacing with margin vs flex alignment

  Fixed-width layouts and centering strategies

  Debugging layout inconsistencies using browser DevTools


**Challenges & Solutions:**

  While building the layout, I encountered spacing issues, particularly around justify-content behavior (center vs space-around) and how margins compound between elements.

  Through debugging and inspecting computed layout values, I refined the structure to achieve precise spacing and consistent alignment across sections.

  This project strengthened my understanding of how Flexbox distributes space and how container width interacts with item sizing and margin calculations.
